    <h1>19-701-046 Kenan TAŞDEMİR</h1>
    <article>
        Hi my name is Kenan and this is my third grade at computer technologies and information systems department. Almost four years ago i was totally unfamiliar with programming. İ was completely  know-nothing about programming, All my purposes about using computer were the basic stuffs, like basic cmd commands, games, music, videos. Now i am quite different from when i just started the college. İf i able to have to give an example about differences, My perspective on computers has changed. 
İ have willingness to improve myself in different areas such as mobile development,web development,database management, linux, powershell.
Lately, i am interested in mobile application development. Nowadays İ spend most of my time for this.
I also spend my time with reading, hang out with my friends,watching movies or tv series, taking a walk on beach. 

The technologies i've learnt in the last three years
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node js,Express js,Mongo db ,Linux, Python,Vue js, Kotlin Bootstrap,Postgre SQL,SQLlite, Redis, Docker, Kubernete.

İ always ask myself "Where do you want to see yourself future 5 years". The answer of that question is my dream job. İ want to be a system administrator.

        <h3>Purpose of my dream project</h3>
I want to develop a mobile application that brings together people who want to learn any foreign language. İ will develop the application using Kotlin. The application will be similar to today's social media applications. The difference from today's social media platforms is the purpose of development of the application. 
Target Group
Anybody who want to learn any language can use this application.

        <h3>Justification of this application</h3>
While people are learning a foreign language, they need to accelerate their foreign language learning processes by interacting with other people who speak that language. People often meet these needs from paid private lessons. However, this can be a financial challenge for some users. This application will be developed in order to address this challenge that people face.

        <h3>İncome Expectations</h3>

This application to be developed is completely free to download. However, users will be charged a monthly fee of 20 TL in order to move their posts higher and increase their popularity.
The 1-year target of the application is 10 thousand downloads and the income expectation is 1000 users to purchase a premium membership. Thus, the annual income expectation of 20000 TL will be met.

        <h3>The way of usage</h3>
Users will be able to communicate with each other using the classical correspondence method. If they wish, they will be able to communicate via voice call or video call. if they want texting, they will be able to improve their reading skills. in this method, users also can send voice messages. In video and audio calls, users will be able to improve their listening skills and establish more intimate relationships. In addition, if there is a word whose pronunciation is misunderstood in the video call, it will be able to send a written message to the user during the video call. Also each user will have a friend list.Users will be able to add each other to their friend lists and. Users can upload a photo as a profile photo, also they can post anything in the main page(idea,image). 

<h3>Possible Risks in Its Use</h3>
To talk about the risks in the use of this application, there may be users who disturb people. Users who act in this way will be warned the first time they occur. Further violations will result in a reprimand. In the third violation, the mac address of the user's device will be included in the blocked users list. Thus, this user will not be able to disturb people again unless they change the device.
